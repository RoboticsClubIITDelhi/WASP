## ü§ñ Project Overview - WASP (Wireless and Similitude Positioning System)

The aim of this project is to make a bot that would identify its location in space with respect to the accessing points using an ESP-8266 WI-FI module, and the bot would then traverse to the required location in an obstruction-free space as per the input location of the user, using method of trilateration, and algorithms like kalman filter.

# üìö Theory:

- [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
- [ESP 8266 AT Firmware](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/at)
- _For rest of the theory and documentation, refer to [resources subfolder](https://github.com/RoboticsClubIITDelhi/WASP/tree/main/resources)_



# üéØ Design Goals
## CAD
-  Design an ESP-controlled differential car.

## Wifi and Access Point Setup
-  Try and test 4 ESP 8266 wifi modules and capture the data for the arena with signal strength

## Electronics and PCB designing :
-  Design PCB - Access point PCB with case
-  IMU Calibration using magnetometer

## Programming:
-  Programming a Kalman filter to fuse the data of the IMU and the WIFI positioning system.

## üß† Algorithm Development

The core of WASP lies in its localization and navigation algorithms, designed to achieve accurate indoor positioning where GPS is unreliable. The development process involved the following key steps:

### 1. WiFi-Based Trilateration
- The robot uses **ESP8266 modules** to scan for known WiFi access points placed at fixed positions.  
- Received Signal Strength Indicator (**RSSI**) values are converted into approximate distances using a calibrated free-space path loss model.  
- Trilateration mathematics is then applied to estimate the robot‚Äôs **2D position**.

### 2. Inertial Measurement and Dead Reckoning
- A **9-DoF IMU** provides acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic heading.  
- These readings are integrated to estimate short-term motion (**odometry**).  
- **Magnetometer calibration routines** (e.g., figure-eight procedure) are performed before each run to reduce heading bias.

### 3. Sensor Fusion with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- The EKF maintains a state vector of **position, heading, and velocity**.  
- **Predict step:** IMU-based dead-reckoning projects the next pose.  
- **Update step:** WiFi-based trilateration measurements correct long-term drift.  
- This fusion balances the strengths of each sensor, yielding **smoother and more reliable localization**.

### 4. Navigation and Control
- **Waypoint navigation algorithms** convert target coordinates into motor commands.  
- **PID controllers** regulate speed and heading, ensuring stable motion.  
- The system continuously updates its estimated position and adjusts motor outputs to move towards the goal.

### 5. Calibration and Error Handling
- **Path-loss constants** are calibrated through offline RSSI sampling.  
- The system compensates for **multipath reflections** and **magnetic disturbances** through adaptive filtering and calibration.  
- If fewer than three APs are detected, the robot falls back to **odometry** or holds its **last known position**.

## Future Algorithm Enhancements

To extend WASP beyond its current prototype, several algorithmic improvements are envisioned:

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Integration of ultrasonic, infrared, or LiDAR sensors to dynamically detect and avoid obstacles.  
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Implementing LiDAR- or vision-based SLAM to enable real-time map building and localization.  
- **Advanced Path Planning:** Incorporating algorithms like A*, D*, or RRT for optimized multi-room navigation.  
- **Multi-Floor Navigation:** Using barometric sensors or 5G beacons to enable vertical positioning in multi-story environments.  
- **User Interaction:** Developing mobile or web interfaces for selecting target destinations and monitoring navigation progress.  

These future enhancements will transition WASP from a basic localization prototype into a **robust autonomous indoor navigation platform** capable of operating in realistic, dynamic environments.








# ‚è±Ô∏è Project Timeline
Main idea is to build a very very basic version first, probably within 2 weeks and then work on modifying it

## Week 1: Introduction
-  Review the project documentations
-  Be familiar with github
-  Brainstorm ideas and design concepts based on the project 
-  Prepare Bill of Materials
-  Draft electronic system diagram, CAD and PCB for access points


## Week 2: Hardware Assembly
-  Assemble components to make a rudimentary bot
-  Assemble rudimentary wifi access points

## Week 3: Programming wifi access points
-  Programming using usb to uart converter
-  Debugging esp8266 board issues while uploading code (* more on it in #issues section)

## Week 4: Making all access points and Central Bot programming
-  All 4 access points by designing our own PCB on perf boards
-  Made functions in central bot to read RSSI data of all the wifi access points

## Weeks 5-7: Progressive Enhancements in central bot code
- Implemented Functions to get distance from measured RSSI values on a separate module
- Calibrated the function by testing at various distances to accurately get the calibrated coefficents 
- Merged these functions into the exiisting central bot code
- Tested out kalman filter functions and added that into our Central bot code
- further debugging and refinements

## Weeks 8-9: Hardware improvements and locomotion
- Refined access point circuits
- Refined central bot chassis
- added controls to run the bot via buttons on a self-hosted website
- added a button to get cordinates of bot on the website

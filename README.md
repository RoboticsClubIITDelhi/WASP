## ü§ñ Project Overview

~~This repository houses the codebase for the **!TODO(project name)**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including code, CAD models, calculations, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.~~

The aim of this project is to make a bot that would identify its location in space with respect to the accessing points using an ESP-8266 WI-FI module, and the bot would then traverse to the required location in an obstruction-free space as per the input location of the user, using method of trilateration, and algorithms like kalman filter.


### üéØ Design Goals
# CAD
-  Design an ESP-controlled differential car.

# Wifi and Access Point Setup
-  Try and test 4 ESP 8266 wifi modules and capture the data for the arena with signal strength

# Electronics and PCB designing :
Design PCB - Access point PCB with case
-  IMU Calibration using magnetometer

# Programming:
-  Programming a Kalman filter to fuse the data of the IMU and the WIFI positioning system.


~~some sample~~
~~- ‚úÖ Compact design (within 100√ó100mm)~~
~~- ‚úÖ Efficient corner turning capability~~
~~- ‚úÖ Fast maze-solving algorithm~~
~~- ‚úÖ Differential drive with high-speed motors~~

## ‚è±Ô∏è Project Timeline
Main idea is to build a very very basic version first, probably within 2 weeks and then work on modifying it, (believer me doing otherwise is stupidity...)

### Week 1: Introduction
- Review the competition rulebook
-  Be familiar with github
-  Brainstorm ideas and design concepts based in the video,
-  Prepare Bill of Materials
-  Draft electronic system diagram
-  !TODO()


### Week 2: Hardware Assembly
-  Assemble mechanical components
- !TODO()

### Week 3: Debugging
-  Hardware and software troubleshooting
-  !TODO()

### Week 4: Algorithm Refinement
-  Enhance hardware robustness
-  !TODO()

### Weeks 5-7: Progressive Enhancements
- üîÑ Implement iterative improvements (tbd)
- !TODO()

## üìö Resources

### Tools and References (tbd)
- !TODO()

### Development Software
- !TODO()



## ü§ù Contributor Notes
- We follow the [standard Git workflow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-workflows-with-open-source-collaboration/) for collaboration
- Suggestions for improvement are welcome via **Issues** or Discussions.

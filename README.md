## ü§ñ Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase for the **!TODO(project name)**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including code, CAD models, calculations, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.

### üéØ Design Goals
!ToDo

some sample
- ‚úÖ Compact design (within 100√ó100mm)
- ‚úÖ Efficient corner turning capability
- ‚úÖ Fast maze-solving algorithm
- ‚úÖ Differential drive with high-speed motors


## üß† Algorithm Development
!ToDo()

## ‚è±Ô∏è Project Timeline
Main idea is to build a very very basic version first, probably within 2 weeks and then work on modifying it, (believer me doing otherwise is stupidity...)

### Week 1: Introduction
- Review the competition rulebook
-  Be familiar with github
-  Brainstorm ideas and design concepts based in the video,
-  Prepare Bill of Materials
-  Draft electronic system diagram
-  !TODO()


### Week 2: Hardware Assembly
-  Assemble mechanical components
- !TODO()

### Week 3: Debugging
-  Hardware and software troubleshooting
-  !TODO()

### Week 4: Algorithm Refinement
-  Enhance hardware robustness
-  !TODO()

### Weeks 5-7: Progressive Enhancements
- üîÑ Implement iterative improvements (tbd)
- !TODO()

## üìö Resources

### Tools and References (tbd)
- !TODO()

### Development Software
- !TODO()



## ü§ù Contributor Notes
- We follow the [standard Git workflow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-workflows-with-open-source-collaboration/) for collaboration
- Suggestions for improvement are welcome via **Issues** or Discussions.
